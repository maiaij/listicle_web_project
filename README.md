Listicle is a website designed to help you keep track of your favourite books and shows! You can start by clicking the Login / Signup button
in the upper-right hand corner, or bottom middle. From here, you will have the option to either login to an already exisiting account, or sign up for
a new one. Once this is done, the user will be able to see all the items they have created. Users will have the option to add a new list, or search for a book or show
to add to their list. Users will also be able to click on their shows/books to get more info on them such as their rating, progress and notes. When the user is done, they can
click the logout button to logout.

For testing:
username : admin@test.ca
password : test123
